# Blogging Website Project

# Overview

In this project I developed a blogging website using the skills learnt through the _Programming with Web Technology_ paper. The project will also gives the opportunity use online resources to discover and apply content not taught within the course.

Through the website, users can register for an account, which is needed to be able to post articles and to leave comments on others. When logged in, they have full control of the content they have authored: creating, updating and deleting their content and comments.
